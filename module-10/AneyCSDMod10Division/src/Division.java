/**
Jonah Aney July 13th, 2025 CSD-402 Module-10: Divisions

* Complete the following:

    Create an abstract Division class with fields for a company's division name and account number, and an abstract display () method that will be defined in the subclasses.
    Use a constructor in the superclass that requires values for both fields.
    Create two subclasses named InternationalDivision and DomesticDivision.
    The InternationalDivision class includes a field for the country in which the division is located, a field for the language spoken, and a constructor that requires all fields when created.
    The DomesticDivision class includes a field for the state in which the division is located and a constructor that requires all fields when created.â€¯
    Write an application named UseDivision that creates two instances of each of these concrete classes (4 total instances).
    Save the files as: Division, InternationalDivision, DomesticDivision, and UseDivision.
