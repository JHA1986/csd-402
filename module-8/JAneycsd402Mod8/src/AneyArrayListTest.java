Create a class [yourName]ArrayListTest .â€¯Examples:

    TomArrayListTest
    SueArrayListTest
    CindyArrayListTest

Etc.
This class is to contain:

    A method that receives an ArrayList populated with an Integer data type holding the integers received from user input.
    The user input is to accept Integers that are then assigned to the ArrayList until a value of 0 is entered, which is also assigned to the ArrayList.
    The ArrayList is then to be sent to the method.
    The method is then to return the largest value in the ArrayList.
    If the ArrayList is sent in empty, the method will then return 0.
    The method signature is to be public static Integer max (ArrayList list).
    Write additional code for testing your method.
    The method will return the largest value that is displayed to the user.
